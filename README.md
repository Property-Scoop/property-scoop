### User Stories:
 
As a user, I want to input address and get this address displayed on the google map.
As a user, I want to see my location on the map.
As a user, I want to input the address and get the construction information about this building.
As a developer, I want to show the information in a comprehensive way.
As a developer, I want to programmatically able to query user's locations.
As a user , I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my application is easy to navigate.
As a developer I want to associate a user’s location using geocode API and seattle.gov API.
 
### Problem Domain:
 
When searching addresses, the user may be curious of the owner, the value of the building and other information regarding the location. Project-scoop solves this problem with providing this information when an address is inputed. We are utilizing express, init, dotenv, cors, superagent, ejs, postgres and method override.
 
### Conflict plan.
What will your group do when it encounters conflict? After 15 minutes of debate we will take a vote on the issue.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? We will talk to them as a group.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful? If after a group discussion conflict is not resolved, will go to the instructor for mediation.
We will try to make decisions as a group to delegate code features.
 
### Merge conflict plan:
 
#### Our branches:
 
Master branch, the branch where we have only working clean code.
Staging branch, the branch where we upload the working code before merging it to master.
Our branches with our names, the branches where we are actually writing and testing code. We can use semantic names also, but the name of the developer should go first.
 
#### Rules:
 
1. Only Ludwin can merge to master.
2. He can merge to master the only code that is working.
3. We can do only the tasks that are assigned to our names in Trello (we still need to decide together who will do what)
4. Every time before writing any code we need to pull all changes that our teammates made from Stages branch to our name branch.
5. When one of our tasks is done and code is properly working we can merge it to the Staging branch and we MUST tell the team what task was done and that it was merged to staging.
6. We should leave descriptive comments in our code so it would be easy to understand and navigate.

### Communication plan: 
We will communicate through slack.
Everyone’s contact numbers are as follows:
 
### Project scope:
We want to have an mvp ready for thursday. The application should have an input for address ( or use the users location) and when submited it should display the address on a map and information about the address. The application should have basic styling.
