Conflict plan.
What will your group do when it encounters conflict? After 15 minutes of debate we will take a vote on the issue.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? We will talk to them as a group.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful? If after a group discussion conflict is not resolved, will go to the instructor for mediation.
We will try to make decisions as a group to delegate code features. 
 
Communication plan:  We will communicate through slack.
Project scope:   We want to have an mvp ready for thursday. The application should have an input for address ( or use the users location) and when submited it should display the address on a map and information about the address. The application should have basic styling.
